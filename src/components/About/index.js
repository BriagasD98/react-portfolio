                 and creative thinking to find success. Recently earned a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development through 
                 The University of Texas at Austin. Newly developed skills in the MERN stack such as React, MongoDB, Express 
                 and Node. Skills to make a visually appealing & responsive website include CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma and Handlebars.

                 With each project, my goal is to keep my target audience engaged and create recurring users on the site. 
                 I have worked effectively on a team multiple times to deliver a project by specific deadlines. Iâ€™m excited
