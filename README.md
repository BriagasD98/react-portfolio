## React-Portfolio
My challenge this week was to build a professional portfolio using **React.js**. I've built a portfolio once before using primarily HTML & CSS. The goal 
of this challenge was to showcase my new skills while utilizing the tech industry's latest technology such as **React.js and Node.js**. My **React Portfolio**
is a **Single-Page Application** which consists of 4 main pages: **About, Contact, Resume, and Portfolio**. Users may change the displayed content as they 
navigate through the **component tabs** that each render unique content without refreshing the entire application. There is also live **links** to my 
social media platforms such as **Github, StackOverflow** as well as a **link to my downloadable resume**. Users may also contact me throught the **Contact**
page by entering their **name, email and message** into input boxes. In the **Portfolio** page, there are **content tiles** which each display **unique
projects** that i've worked on as well as links to the **Deployed Applications & Repositories**. <br/>
